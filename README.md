# Credit Score Classification

This project focuses on classifying individuals' credit scores into categories such as **Poor**, **Standard**, and **Good** using machine learning techniques. It includes data preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation to select the most accurate classifier.

## 📌 Project Description

The notebook contains:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data cleaning and handling of missing values
- Feature encoding and scaling
- Training various machine learning models including:
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - XGboost
  - SVM
  - logistic regression
- Comparing model performance using accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrix
- Final model selection based on evaluation metrics

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset used in this project is publicly available on Kaggle:

🔗 [Credit Score Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/parisrohan/credit-score-classification)

Make sure to download the dataset and place it in the appropriate directory as specified in the notebook.

## 🛠️ Installation & Requirements

To run this project, you'll need Python and the following packages:

- pandas  
- numpy  
- matplotlib  
- seaborn  
- scikit-learn  

You can install all dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or manually install them via pip.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mohamedsalama677/Credit_Score_Classification.git
cd Credit_Score_Classification
```

2. Open the Jupyter notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook Credit_Score_Final.ipynb
```

3. Follow the steps in the notebook to explore the data, preprocess it, train models, and evaluate them.

## 📈 Model Evaluation

The notebook provides performance comparisons between models using:
- Accuracy
- Classification report
- Confusion matrix

This helps identify the most suitable model for the credit score classification task.
